# Abstract

Our team developed a solution that allows the users to upload a picture of their desired clothing item and to quickly find the most similar and personalised second hand item on the platform vinted.com.

# Project Summary
### Organising the Work

At the beginning of the project, the team consisted of 3 UX designers, 2 Web Developers (WD) and 3 Artificial Intelligence members (AI). During the course of the project phase the team had to deal with three dropouts, which gladly were not critical for our work. Only three (2 Web Developers and 1 AI member) of the five-member team had gotten to know each other superficially during the theory phase at the TechLabs GitHub Workshop. All other members were complete strangers to each other. Everyone also learned completely new material and gained new knowledge.

Hence the first challenge of the project already became apparent. We had to organise ourselves without knowing the strengths/weaknesses of each other. Nor did we know the working style or anything about the individual character of each member. We also were not able to estimate our individual level of knowledge for this kind of project scope, where we had to put theory immediately into practice in a short amount of time. So the first two weeks of the project phase were characterised by uncertainty and lack of clarity. We didnâ€™t know where to start. How should we bring the different tracks together? Are the different tracks able to apply the new and huge amount of knowledge? And are we then able to bring everything together as a cross functional team? 

During the first two weeks the need for a project manager became more and more noticeable, even though no one formulated this explicitly. The task of the project manager was to work out the overall view of the upcoming tasks, the priorities and the time schedule and to make it transparent for all tracks. This task was taken over by a member of the WD team and he was accepted by team members in his role. There was no official vote, instead it evolved naturally through the project phase. 

We agreed very quickly on a weekly Jour Fixe, where each track regularly presented an update on the current work of the respective team and hence we tried to establish fixed working structures. For further communication, we used Slack. Both structural elements were sufficient for us throughout the project and helped us coordinate our work. As another tool for work organisation, we used the virtual board Miro. This is where we recorded our minutes for the weekly Jour Fixe. As the project progressed, the other most important work tool was the Kanban board, where each team recorded the tasks to be completed. Our decision to use the Kanban board was based on the realisation that for our agile and incremental way of working, traditional project plans or timelines were blocking our progress rather than helping. This was because we had to constantly re-evaluate and adjust our MVP features and tasks in order to bring the project to a successful conclusion. 

Our greatest success in this area is that we came together as strangers and grew together as a team that supported each other despite all adversities and challenges. We also learned to be flexible, make decisions quickly, and adapt instantly to any change, which made us resilient as a team. In certain situations our project mentor was very helpful and supported us because he pointed us in the right direction when we needed guidance or advice. 

### Problem Identification
The original project problem arised due to the fact that vinted.com and second hand websites in general do not offer personalized clothing suggestions when shopping online. After an intense brainstorming session with our team, we identified three additional problems within the second hand online shopping market:

1. No Personalized Suggestions
2. Fragmented Supply
3. Time Consuming Second Hand Shopping
4. Inflated Prices

But before we started creating a product matching these problems, we tried to better understand the market we aimed to penetrate as well as its consumers. Therefore we conducted both, market research as well as user surveys. And luckily, the results of both analysis were consistent. They showed that 1) there seems to be an increasing trend towards second hand hand shopping and 2), the second hand market is predicted to grow from $30bn to $80bn in the next five years. So this shows that there is indeed both 1) a consumer need as well as 2) promising market growth wherefore we decided to develop our FashUp plattform. But how to align all four problems and form a solution? A computer vision model of course! **The ultimate goal was to find a solution that allows end-users to upload his/her favorite clothing item and to quickly find the most personalized secondhand item.**

For implementation purposes, we divided the project into three main blocks:

1. UX/UI: Validating Problem and building design
2. Web Development: Creating a Website
3. Artificial Intelligence: Building the MVP functionality

### Understanding the user: UX User Research

Understanding the user is the first step in the UX Design process, which many sources refer to in different ways. In this step, we try to understand the user for whom we will build this service, and we try to access the logic behind their decisions. This includes user research, persona creation and user story creation. 

We had a total of 33 participants for our study, which is not a great number, but given the time frame, it was enough to give us insight into the general online shopping group's preferences and early views. We designed a simple Google form to share the questions with the wider audience. From the beginning of the winter break until the fourth week before the midterm, we worked on it. It clarified things for us and allowed us to go forward with our endeavour. The important findings from our online survey are summarised below. The format and specifics of our online survey may be seen in the FashUp Report's UX directory.

The most interesting finding of our online survey was that our target group values a good price and a desire for long-term sustainability. Major market research came to the same result as we did, predicting a market rise of 30 billion to 80 billion dollars over the next five years, or a 15% to 20% increase per year.
