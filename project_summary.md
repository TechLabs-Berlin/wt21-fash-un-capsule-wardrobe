# Project Summary Fashup

At a time when sustainability is becoming increasingly important in our society, a higher demand for pre-owned / second hand clothing can be observed. As with almost everything these days, a shift to the Internet can be seen in this area as well. Different platforms emerged over the past few years offering a wide range of options to search for and buy pre-owned fashion. What is a positive development on the one hand can become problematic on the other if the market is highly fragmented, making it difficult for users to find the right item of clothing. Inaccurate product descriptions, possibly incorrect categorizations and a lack of personalized product suggestions contribute to an unsatisfactory user experience.

Fashup is a web app that is developed to solve these problems by making it easier and quicker to find the desired clothing item  throughout several
platforms (limited to vinted.com in the starting phase). By uploading a picture of a clothing item that represents the preferred style, the user will be
shown the most similar items that are currently available on the respective platforms in a matter of seconds. This is made possible by the use of an
AI-model that recognizes the type as well as the style of the uploaded clothing item and identifies matching pieces.

While improving the user experience in second hand online shopping, Fashup is supporting a sustainable approach to fashion as well.

Fashup is built using Python, Flask, PyTorch, Jina AI, NodeJS, and ReactJS.
